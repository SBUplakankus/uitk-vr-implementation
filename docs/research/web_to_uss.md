# Web Styling to Unity

## Overview

USS is does not have all the features CSS has in 2026 but it is still capable of most of the features. I tested some basic ones out and if you look for some simple samples on uiverse.io, they should be convertable to UITK.

The main challenge with VR is the performance and what can be translated over without much of a hit. Just using USS Colouring, Animations and Effects works great but detail through shader graph and materials will need to be debugged. Simple gradiants which is going to be the most common should be fine however.

## Workflow

The common Web Workflow of HTML / CSS / JS translates near identically to UXML / USS / CS. Tweens outside of the panel I would do using Prime Tween but DOTween should work just as fine.
