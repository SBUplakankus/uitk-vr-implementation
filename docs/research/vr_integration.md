# UITK VR Integration

## Overview

While you can use UITK Buttons and Sliders on the World Space Canvas, they are 2D and don't take advantage of the cool tactile 3D Buttons and Interactions the Meta SDK provides which greatly improves the UX Experience.

This means that we will need to keep our UITK Components to almost strictly visual then find a middle ground to communicate between the UITK Hosts and Interaction Events. This should be doable in C# and not effect any existing systems too much.

### UITK Elements

- Panels

- Images

- Text

- Animations

- Shader Effects

### Meta Elements

- Button Interactions

- Slider Interactions (Maybe)

### Tween Elements

- Full Panel Motion
